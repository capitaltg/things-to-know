- Learn about remote repositories, such as GitHub or GitLab, and how to push and pull changes.
- Understand branching strategies like GitFlow and best practices for collaborative development with Git.
- How to use:
  - [git blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame)
  - [git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)
  - [git cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick)
  - [git commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)
  - [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)
  - [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)
